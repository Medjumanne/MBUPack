# MBUPack

MBUPack is a comprehensive package for the analysis of mosquito data. The name "MBU" is not only a playful abbreviation for "Mosquito Biology Unit", a term coined by the creator of this package, but also the Swahili word for mosquito.

The package currently contains a module called "ifakara", which is under active development. This module provides a comprehensive toolkit for analyzing mosquito data. It includes functions for mosquito population age structure analysis, mosquito ovarian dissection data analysis, mosquito species distribution analysis, and mosquito diversity indices analysis. These tools can help researchers better understand mosquito populations and their impacts on disease transmission.

In the future, the "ifakara" module may be renamed to "MBUPack" to reflect the overarching goal of the project.
