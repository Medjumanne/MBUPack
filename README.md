# MBUPack

MBUPack is a comprehensive package for the analysis of mosquito data. The name "MBU" is not only a playful abbreviation for "Mosquito Biology Unit", a term coined by the creator of this package, but also the Swahili word for mosquito.

The package currently contains a module called "ifakara", which is under active development. In the future, the "ifakara" module may be renamed to "MBUPack" to reflect the overarching goal of the project.
