\title{Calculate Diversity Indices for Each Site}
\usage{
dmima(data, sites = colnames(data)[-1])
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame where each row represents a species (taxon) and each
column represents a site. The first column should be the species names, and
the rest of the columns should be the counts of each species at each site.}

\item{sites}{A character vector of site names to include in the analysis.
If not provided, all sites in the data will be included.}
}
\value{
A dataframe where each row corresponds to a site and the columns
represent the Shannon Index, Simpson Index, Inverse Simpson Index, and Species Richness.
}
\description{
This function calculates the Shannon Index, Simpson Index, Inverse Simpson Index, and Species Richness for each site in a data frame of species counts.
}
\examples{
# Hypothetical data
data <- data.frame(
  Taxon = c("Species1", "Species2", "Species3", "Species4"),
  Site1 = c(5, 3, 0, 7),
  Site2 = c(2, 0, 6, 1),
  Site3 = c(1, 8, 2, 0),
  Site4 = c(7, 1, 3, 4)
)

# Calculate the diversity indices for all sites
diversity_indices <- dmima(data)

# Print the diversity indices
print(diversity_indices)
